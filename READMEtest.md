incomplete Selective sweep With Extended haplotypes Estimation Procedure

This software presents a statistical methodology for inferring the selection coefficient and the allele frequency of a single adaptive allele introduced to a population in the recent 50-600 generations. It uses identity-by-descent segments, i.e., pairwise matching long haplotypes, to make these inferences. The methodology proposes a parametric statistical model that relates segment data to population genetics and coalescent trees.
