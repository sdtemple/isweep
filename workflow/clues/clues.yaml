# change these
# this snakemake will only run after running an isweep/workflow/simulate/
CHANGE:
  # folders, file name of simulation study *.tsv
  FOLDERS:
    YAML: 'clues.yaml'
    # folder for macro experiments
    MACRO: '/projects/browning/brwnlab/seth/isweep/workflow/simulate/bottle'
    # tsv file describing simulations
    MICRO: '/projects/browning/brwnlab/seth/isweep/workflow/simulate/experiments/simstudy.expand.tsv'
    # forlder where terminal scripts are
    TERMINALSCRIPTS: '/projects/browning/brwnlab/seth/isweep/workflow/clues/terminalscripts'
    # folder where software is
    SOFTWARE: '/projects/browning/brwnlab/seth/software'
  PROGRAMS:
    # these under software
    RELATE: 'relate_v1.1.9_x86_64_static' # where is relate
    CLUES: 'clues' # where is clues
  RELATE:
    BUFFER: '100000' # choose buffer size in bp
    NUMSAM: '500' # choose num of mcmc branch lengths
    COAL: 'coarse.coal' # file made beforehand of --coal input to Relate
    # you can change this
    # i suggest running coarse-coal.py on Ne file in simulation study
    # you could use a 1000 genomes population
    # https://zenodo.org/record/3234689
    SAMPLE: 'relate.subsample.v2.txt' # file made beforehand of individual names
    # use linux head command and bcftools query -l

# keep these fixed
FIXED:
  # simulation study settings
  SIMULATE:
    # match to isweep simulation study
    LOC: '3999999'
    MU: '1e-8'
