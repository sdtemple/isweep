# change these
CHANGE:

  FOLDERS:
    # folder for analysis
    STUDY: '/path-to-study/sequence-data'
    # the yaml file with scan analysis options
    YAML: 'this-file.yaml'

  # parameters, subsample file
  ISWEEP:
    # lowest chromosome number
    CHRLOW: '1'
    # highest chromosome numbers
    CHRHIGH: '22'
    CASES: 'phenotype.txt'
    XMXMEM: '120' # in gb
    THREADS: '12'
    CMSTEPSIZE: '0.05' # in cM (step size)
    GENOMESIZE: '3300' # in cM (all chromosomes summed)
    CONFLEVEL: '0.05'
    SIMS: '0' # simulations to derive OU threshold
    # with 0, simulation approach will give Z score of -100

  EXISTING:

# keep these fixed
FIXED:

  ISWEEP:
    # scanning parameters
    CMGAP: '0.5' # cM gap when concatenating regions of excess IBD
    TELOSIGMA: '3.0' # sigma scalar to remove telomeres
    CMCOVER: '0.25' # excess ibd rate must extend this long in cM
    CMSMALL: '2.0' # region is extended w/ buffer if too small
    MBBUF: '2' # mb buffer if cm not long enough
    AUTOCOVLEN: '4.' # in cM, how much data to learn autocovariance
